Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
A.it is a way to store multiple values in same object


What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
A.Insertion, Deletion,Traversal,Searching, and Sorting

List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
A.data base, and Graphics, Machine learning, data sciences.

what is an Array?
A. an object that contains multiple values

what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
A. array is static and is fixed length.
   arraylist is dynamic and is variable length.

what is LinkedList?
A.linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are linked using pointers.

How is an ArrayList different from Linked List?
A.Arraylist is storing the value in a block and linked list stores the value in nodes.
 linked list is easier and faster

what is queue?
A. is a linear data structure, and it is collection of order element in FIFO order

what is stack?
A.is a linear data structure that is used to store collection and object, it is a collection that follows LIFO/FILO order.

what is FIFO and LIFO?
A. FIFO:first in/first out
   LIFO: last in/first ou

what is the order of complexity?
A.Order of complexity is a measure of how long an algorithm would take to complete given an input of size n.
  Assuming the input  of size N, we can say that the algorithm will finish at O(N), O(N^2), O(N^3), O(N*log(N)) etc.

what is the best case to search an element from an array?
A.the map is always the best case to search an element from an array.

what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
A.is searching element one by one until the element is found.

what is tree in data structure?
A.Tree is a non-linear data structure where data objects are organized in terms of hierarchical relationship

what is graph in data structure?
A. is a non linear data structure and it is presentation of nodes lined together without specific order.

what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
A.HashTable is synchronized and HashMap is not synchronized.

What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
A. RDBMS uses Array
   Network data model uses Graph.
   Hierarchical data model uses Trees.

How HashMap works in java?
A. HashMap work in (Key ,Value)

What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
A.is an error and it occurs whenever we try to retrieve an element with an index that is out of the array holder.

What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
A.Arrays.copy, System.cloun(), and manually

What is difference between an array and a linked list?
A.An array is a collection of elements of a similar data type.
  A linked list is a collection of objects known as a node where node consists of two parts

What is DFS and BFS?
A.DFS: Depth-first search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures.
  BFS: Breadth-first search is an algorithm for searching a tree data structure for a node that satisfies a given property.

What is Recursion?
A. Recursion is when a method calls itself.

What are linear and non linear data Structures?
A.linear:array, stack, queue, linked list.
  non linear: graphs and trees

What is Big-(O)-notation?
A.Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function
  when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity.
  big O notation is used to classify algorithms according to how their run time
   or space requirements grow as the input size grows.

Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?
A.Insertion sorting: is a simple sorting algorithm.The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part.
                    Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part

  Selection sorting:  is selecting the smallest value and take it to the index.

  Bubble sorting:  is getting two indexes and checks if the right index is less than the left one and swaps the values

  Bucket sorting:  is putting the values is different buckets (for temple from 0-5 in a bucket
                   nd 6-10 in another 11-15 in an another and so on),sorting the values in each bucket and at the end
                   gathering the values.

  Marge sorting:  the list of values wil split and then checks 2 values and always take the smallest an reorder the values..

  Heap sorting: is a comparison-based sorting technique based on Binary Heap data structure. It is similar to selection
                sort where we first find the minimum element and place the minimum element at the beginning.
                We repeat the same process for the remaining elements.

  Quick sorting:

Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
